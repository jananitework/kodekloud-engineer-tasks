Scenario: The System admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers. As per the tool requirements they need to create a user with a 
non-interactive shell. Therefore, create a user named kareem with a non-interactive shell in the app02 server.

```
ssh steve@stapp02
sudo id kareem
sudo adduser kareem -s /sbin/nologin/
sudo cat /etc/passwd |grep kareem
```
