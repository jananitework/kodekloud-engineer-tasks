Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

1. Check if ssh public and private keys are present.
```
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ cd
thor@jump_host ~$ cd -
/home/thor/.ssh
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ls
authorized_keys
```

2. Generate key pairs
```
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:UlfS4EjL0ISsGx8A4s6GHZU7mx3CtHARFT06cmnSOJc thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|. ..+*+*o oo.    |
|....= o+++ o.    |
| ..= B +=.o      |

+----[SHA256]-----+
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ls -lart
total 20

```

3. Copy the public key using ssh-copy-id to user1
```
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh-copy-id 
Usage: /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id [-h|-?|-f|-n] [-i [identity_file]] [-p port] [[-o <ssh -o options>] ...] [user@]hostname
        -f: force mode -- copy keys without trying to check if they are already installed
        -n: dry run    -- no keys are actually copied
        -h|-?: print this help
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:gt7zWL3sSWwOWuRHJ7xX2ziwCjFInj3tM4TKT+uIP3E.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
tony@stapp01's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'tony@stapp01'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh tony@stapp01
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ logout
Connection to stapp01 closed.
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$
```

4. Copy the public key using ssh-copy-id to user2
```
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host 'stapp02 (172.16.238.11)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:mB2CpYVyY+YhcH0MN49v58GlzomQNeYInzpEstvBJNM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
steve@stapp02's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'steve@stapp02'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh steve@stapp02
[steve@stapp02 ~]$ logout
Connection to stapp02 closed.
```

5. Copy the public key using ssh-copy-id to user3
```
thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host 'stapp03 (172.16.238.12)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:/Rs1vNlY4RNWARmxKjeLPantAtBm2S3gjDsLF9oiab4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
banner@stapp03's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'banner@stapp03'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

thor@jump_host ~/.ssh$ ssh banner@stapp03
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ 
```

6. Check if the id_ras.pub generated in jump server is present in authorized_keys in all other hosts.
```
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ cat ./.ssh/authorized_keys | grep thor
ssh-rsa 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 thor@jump_host.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
