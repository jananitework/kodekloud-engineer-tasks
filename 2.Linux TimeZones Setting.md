During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is America/Kralendijk

```

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
