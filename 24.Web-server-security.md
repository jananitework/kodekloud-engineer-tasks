a. On Nautilus App Server 2 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/media on App Server 2. It was detected that the directory /media lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.

Add the following lines in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 

```
ServerSignature Off 
#makes Apache to hide version info on any error pages.
ServerTokens Prod
#However, without the second line ‘ServerTokens Prod’, Apache will still include a detailed server token in HTTP response headers,
```

Now we remove Indexes from this line - it will disable file indexing in the apache server.
``` Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ```
