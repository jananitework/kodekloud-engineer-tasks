There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Also make sure every user can execute it.

Answer:
1. Login to the server
2. Do chmod +x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
3. Execute it like ./tmp/xfusioncorp.sh and check the output
