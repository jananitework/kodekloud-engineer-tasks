Add NTP server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 1.

Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we dont want these changes to be applied right now.

```
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo yum install -y ntp
sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf
cat /etc/ntp.conf |grep sg.pool
```
