If you are using a newer version of sed you can use -i to read from and write to the same file. 
Using -i you can specify a file extension so a backup will be made, incase something went wrong. 
Also you don't need to use the -e flag unless you are using multiple commands

``` sed -i.bak "s/Sample/Cloud/g" /root/nautilus.xml ```
